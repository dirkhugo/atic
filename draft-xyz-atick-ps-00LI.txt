    Problem Statement for End to End Privacy Enabled Mapping System
                       draft-xyz-atick-ps-00.txt

Abstract

   Problem Statement for End to End Privacy Enabled Mapping System for
   Identifier Locator separation systems is presented.  Since
   identifiers are often carried in packet headers in clear, and mapping
   systems are often designed to be accessible by any entity.  To
   preserve identifiers privacy lookups to the mapping system should be
   allowed only by authorized entities and all privacy of the
   identifiers should be preserved.  Persistent identifiers should be
   avoided.  In mapping systems, security requires special attention
   because they may introduce a cache into the data path.  Any denial of
   service attacks on the cache should not allow the communication to
   come to an end.

1.  Introduction

   Current 4G and the upcoming converged communication network of 5G
   core network (5GC) make use of tunneling with anchor points to handle
   mobility, policy and other things.  The use of IP addresses induces
   the topology and enables easy location tracking.  Elimination or
   reduction of anchor points, as well as disassociating topology from
   IP addresses to facilitate efficient mobility and user privacy using
   Identifier Locator separation systems like ILA, ILNP, and LISP is
   needed.  We shortly mention other issues of tunneling here.  In
   addition to increasing packet overhead due to encapsulation that may
   cause fragmentation and all related issues typical disadvantages of
   (especially static end-to-end) tunneling comprise inflexibility to
   properly react to dynamic changes of end points and potential on-path
   anchors which is required to support mobility.

   Added complexity in case of multicast traffic and increased signaling
   for tunnel management are further drawbacks.  Tunnels may introduce
   vulnerabilities (e.g. in terms of attack risks at the anchor points

   or reduced user privacy by association between address and topology)
   or add to the potential for receiver overload and thus DOS attacks
   [I-D.ietf-intarea-tunnels].  Finally without other measures such as
   deep packet inspection optimization of paths according to network
   resources and application needs becomes complex.

   This document attempts to make the case for the use of the identifier
   locator separation (Id-Loc) protocols ILA, ILNP and LISP in the data
   plane and identifies the problems for such a large scale use.  The
   problems identified mainly are privacy of the identifiers and
   associated locators and security issues.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   ILA: Identifier Locator Addressing [I-D.herbert-intarea-ila]

   ILNP: Identifier-Locator Network Protocol RFC 6740 [RFC6740]

   LISP: The Locator/ID Separation Protocol [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis]
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis]

   Identifier: An identifier is information to unambiguously identify an
   entity or an entity group within a given scope.  An identifier is the
   equivalent of an End point identifier (EID) in LISP.  It may be
   visible in communications.

   Locator: A locator is a routable network address.  It may be
   associated with an identifier and used for communication on the
   network layer according to identifier locator split principle.  A
   locator is the equivalent of a Routing Locator (RLOC) in LISP or an
   IP address in ILA, ILNP.

3.  Problem Statement

   Identifier represents a communication end-point of an entity and may
   not be routable.  Locator also represents a communication end point,
   i.e. its routable network address and thus can change if the entity
   moves.  A database called a mapping system needs to be used for
   identifier to locator mapping.  Identifiers are mapped to locators
   for forwarding purposes.  Mapping system has to handle mobility by
   modifying identifier to locator mappings in the database.

   To start the communication, a device needs to know the identifier of
   the destination and then relies on a process to lookup on a network

   identifier and return the locator(s).  Note that both identifier and
   locator can be carried in clear in packet headers.

   Usage of identifiers readily available for public access raises
   privacy issues.  For public entities, it may be desirable to have
   their fully qualified domain names or host names available for public
   lookups by the clients however such is not the case in general for
   the identifiers, e.g. for individuals roaming in a mobile network.

   This document describes the problem statement for a new kind of
   mapping system to be used by identifier locator separation systems
   (Id-Loc) that are end to end privacy enabled.

   Access to a mapping system should not reveal the location about an
   entity to the unauthorized requestor of a look up on an identifier.
   Tracking of the identifiers of an entity and mounting attacks based
   on that should be avoided.  On the other hand discovery by the
   entities that are allowed to should not be made difficult.  This may
   be possible by using encryption effectively in the control plane
   mechanisms to avoid eavesdroppers to access such information
   [I-D.padma-ideas-problem-statement] [I-D.ietf-lisp-sec].

   If locators/ addresses (or device prefixes) are common between flows
   for a given entity then a third party can make inferences (i.e.
   whether they are sourced from the same host).  This points to the
   problem of persistent identifiers which should be avoided.

   Compromise of a mapping system is very bad since it would allow
   attackers to take control of traffic and to misdirect it.

   If locators/ addresses contain fine grained topology then device
   location (and hence user location) can be inferred.  This gets to the
   problem that locators may contain detailed geographic location
   information and hence are very sensitive data.  This points to the
   need for using identifier locator separation.

3.1.  Security In the Data Path

   If a cache is introduced into the data path (as might be the case in
   some mapping systems) then that in turn will introduce potential DoS
   attacks in order to slow down or even completely stop the
   communication.  So proper protocol actions and security policies
   should be taken against DoS attacks.

   Compromise of a mapping system is very bad since it would allow
   attackers to take control of traffic and to misdirect it.
